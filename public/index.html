                <h2>Welcome to the Caltech Berry Marketplace! </h2>
                <p>In order for our beaver brains to work at full capacity,
                    we need healthy fruit! Unfortunately since CDS only offers
                    a very limited selection of fruits under the meal plan, 
                    many students have to find their own nutritious fruits
                    and veggies. We've created a marketplace to share deals
                    and discounts, and buy/sell fruits so that we have 
                    access to plenty of fruits without having to make treks
                    to Trader Joe's or Sprout's.
