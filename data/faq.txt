Why did you choose to start a fruit market?
We chose to start a fruit market because we love fruits and think that they are so important to health. But unfortunately Caltech does not have a great offering so we hope this can help!
Can I customize my order?
Yes! You can customize your order with a note. At the bottom of your cart, you can add a note and customize the color and text of the note. 
What kind of fruit do you sell?
We work with local farmers and our close country neighbors to provide you with the freshest, tastiest, fruit!
How do you search for an item? 
Click the "Product" tab and there is a search feature. Type in the fruit you are looking for and if we offer it, it will show you the information. Otherwise, we unfortuantely do not currently carry the fruit. 
You don't have the fruit I'm looking for. Where can I request it? 
We have a feedback/contact us form under the "Contact Us" tab. Please feel free to send us a message and we will try our hardest to add your fruit to our offerings!
